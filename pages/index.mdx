# Learning Documentation

Welcome to the Learning Documentation. This is a documentation of the learning flow when I want to become a web developer

## Why am I learning this?

In 2022, I enjoyed many things, but I hadn't found a skill that truly resonated with me. I tried being a content creator in graphic design and various other fields. However, it wasn't until the beginning of 2023 that I came across a web development tutorial on YouTube. After considering its future prospects, my interest in this field has grown.

## Beginning

At the outset, I delved into understanding the fundamental concepts, the functionality of the application, and the technologies that needed to be studied. I began by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript these languages form the foundational basis for constructing a website.
